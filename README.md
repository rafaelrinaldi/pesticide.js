pesticide.js
============

This is an attempt to reproduce the same sort of behavior of [Pesticide](http://pesticide.io) but as a bookmarklet instead.

## Usage

Simply drag **[this bookmarklet](http://rinaldi.io/pesticide.js)** to your bookmarks bar and you're ready to go!

## Build

The `build` task will generate the file `pesticide.min.js` which contains minified version of the `pesticide.js`.
